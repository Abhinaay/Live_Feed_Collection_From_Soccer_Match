## Project Description

*	In this project, Rest APIs are created that provides live feeds of a soccer match and results of the matches.
*	MongoDB database is used to store the feeds and results.
*	Spring boot is used as a backend framework.
*	Data is stored and fetched from the database using Java Persistence API.
*	Cross origin resource sharing is enabled for all so that APIs can be used anywhere.
*	MongoDB Atlas is used so that we donâ€™t need to care about deployment of database server.
*	Backend which is written in java is deployed on Heroku, which is a cloud hosting platform.
*	The Rest APIs created can be used by any platform or device.
*	We created a web application that uses these APIs and shows the live feeds and results of soccer matches to the user.
*	Web application is developed using Angular framework and other web technologies.
*	Express.js is used as a framework for node.js.
*	The web application is also deployed on Heroku.
*	GitHub is used for version control.
